Material for Data Quality in a Data Engineering perspective
===========================================================

# Overview
[This project](https://github.com/data-engineering-helpers/data-quality)
intends to document requirements and referential material to improve
data quality through implementation of data validation rules
in the perspective of data engineering on a modern data stack (MDS).

Even though the members of the GitHub organization may be employed by
